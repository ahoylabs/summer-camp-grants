# Ahoy Grants

A Solana program for creating USDC-denominated grants with an on-chain record. 

The Grantor (grant creator) proves control of the funds specified in the grant, while maintaining unilateral control of how / when / to whom the funds are distributed. Any number of Submitters (grant applicants) can submit a project for consideration.
