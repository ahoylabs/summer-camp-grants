# Ahoy Grants

A Solana program for creating transparent, on-chain, USDC-denominated Grants. 

The Grant creator must prove control of the USDC account specified in the grant, but still maintains unilateral control of how / when / to-whom the funds are distributed, if at all. 

Anyone can apply to a given Grant by creating a Submission with a link to their project's Github repo. The Grant creator can choose to pay out any number of submissions.
