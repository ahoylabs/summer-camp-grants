# Ahoy Grants

A Solana program and interface for USDC grants. Built for the 2022 Solana Summer Camp Hackathon as a transparent mechanism for creating and awarding ecosystem grants.

The grant creator designates a USDC account as the source of funds and proves ownership, but still maintains unilateral control over how / when the funds are distributed (if at all). Any number of applicants can submit their project for consideration.

All interactions occur on-chain. Metadata for grants and submissions are stored on IPFS.
